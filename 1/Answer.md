# Homework 1

### 1

a) 3

b) 1

c) 5

### 2

Yes. It has all properties a group needs

- **Closure**: For any two elements a and b in S, the a+b is also in S.
- **Associativity**: The addition of any three a, b and c elements in S: (a+b)+c = a+(b+c).
- **Identity element**: 0 is identity element as for any a in S, a+0 = 0+a = a.
- **Inverse element**: For any non-zero a in S, there is an element -a = 7-a in S such that a+(-a) = (-a)+a = 0. For zero, its inverse is itself.

### 3

-13 mode 5 = 3 \* 5 - 13 = 15 - 13 = 2

### 4

$$
x^3-x^2+4x-12 = (x-2)(x^2 + x + 6)
$$

So, 2 is the root of the polynomial.
The degree of the polynomial is 3, since the highest power of x is 3.
